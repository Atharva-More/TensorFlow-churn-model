# TensorFlow-churn-model
In this GitHub repository, I've employed the powerful Keras library, a part of TensorFlow, to create an accurate churn prediction model. The heart of this project lies in the sequential construction of dense layers within Keras. The 'Dense' layers play a pivotal role in understanding complex patterns in customer data, allowing the model to make informed predictions about customer churn.

Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, I've achieved an impressive 79% accuracy in predicting customer churn. This success is a testament to the capabilities of deep learning and the robustness of the Keras library. My implementation is a valuable resource for businesses seeking to minimize customer churn and maximize their retention strategies.

Feel free to explore the code, data, and model architecture to understand how Keras and diligent data analysis can lead to significant insights and actionable results in the world of customer retention and business growth."
